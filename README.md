## First, we created a model of the container environment.
#### simulation.java: Generate a simulation environment.
#### world.java: Generate a word that includes the timestamp, amount of blocks, amount of buffer stacks, a crane and Functions to change the variable state in the world.
#### stack.java: Define arrive stack, buffer stacks and handover stacks. Here we defined that buffer stacks have three stacks and their capacity is seven, the capacity of the arrive stack is five.
#### block.java: Defined the id of the block, the arrival time of the block, initial position and due time. Then randomly generate the blocks.
#### crane.java: Defined a crane, and a function of the crane state.
#### property.java: Define the time of each action, here all defaults to 1.
#### solver.java: Generate a solver, Depending on the state of the Crane and stacks, the crane is made to move and grip accordingly.

## Second, apply evolutionary algorithms to solve the current model
#### RandomNumberGenerator.java: Randomly generate arrival time, due time and ready time of each block.

#### evaluation.java: public class with static method stepChoice() which takes world as parameter and returns a crane move

### To run the project
- Download ZIP
- Ensure you have JDK installed
- Open in IDE of your choice or navigate to the directory where simulation.java file is stored
- Run in IDE or compile by typing `javac simulation.java`
- Run the program by typing `java simulation`
